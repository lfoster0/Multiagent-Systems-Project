# Cooperative Goal Finding
Project for CPSC 475 Multi Agent Systems at UNBC

Built using the [Jason Framework v1.4.1](http://jason.sourceforge.net/wp/)

### Description
Four agents are tasked with finding their color of block in a small maze, and then taking it back to the start.

As they navigate through the maze they communicate asking each other to move out of the way and informing each other of the location of any blocks they see. The agents can only see what is adjacent to them (not including diagonally) and remember the paths they have taken so they can navigate home after finding their goal.
